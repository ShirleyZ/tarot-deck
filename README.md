# The Seeing Eye Tarot

Link: https://shirleyz.github.io/tarot-deck/

An online tarot deck that you can take with you on the go.

It was created to help visualise spreads, understand draws that don't have a photo, and of course to do your own readings with.

Always open to suggestions and improvements.
